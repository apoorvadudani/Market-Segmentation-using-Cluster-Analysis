# Market-Segmentation-using-R

## Background

Acme Shopping is a large shopping mall that incorporates a balanced tenancy of different types of stores along with eating areas. To understand customers better, I conduct a survey to study beliefs on shopping. I test those beliefs by asking shoppers the six questions listed below. Shoppers then answer using a 7-point Likert scale, from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). My goal is to group the shoppers at Acme Shopping into different segments using Wardâ€™s method. I also collect income and number of visits. The questions are listed below:
 
V1. Shopping is fun
V2. Shopping is bad for your budget
V3. I combine shopping with eating out
V4. I try to get the best buys while shopping
V5. I don't care about shopping
V6. You can save a lot of money by comparing prices

## Data analysis method

To identify the groups, I apply Wards Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering with dendograms to identify the number of clusters in the dataset.

## Interpreting clusters

I interpret the resulting clusters to find actionable patterns or descriptions in the data so I can market to each of the various groups using distinct and effective messaging.
