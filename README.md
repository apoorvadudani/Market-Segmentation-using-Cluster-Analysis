# Market-Segmentation-using-R

You are the data scientist for Acme Shopping, a large shopping mall that incorporates a balanced tenancy of different types of stores along with eating areas. To understand your customers better, you conduct a survey to study beliefs on shopping. You test those beliefs by asking shoppers the six questions listed below. Shoppers then answer using a 7-point Likert scale, from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Your goal is to group the shoppers at Acme Shopping into different segments using Wardâ€™s method. You also collect income and number of visits. The questions are listed below:
 
V1. Shopping is fun
V2. Shopping is bad for your budget
V3. I combine shopping with eating out
V4. I try to get the best buys while shopping
V5. I don't care about shopping
V6. You can save a lot of money by comparing prices

To identify the groups, you will use the statistical software program known as R.
Apply Wards Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering with Dendograms to identify the number of clusters in the dataset. Include a screenshot of the dendogram with boxes or other designations to identify the clusters.
